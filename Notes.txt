The adjoint of "Inverse Gridding" is gridding (without density compensation).
Could still do precompensation (this is equivalent to preconditioning the matrix).

Need to make a function called applyE (this is inverse gridding).
Need to make a function called applyET.
  This is the adjoint of inverse gridding; it's gridding without density compensation.
Need to make a function called inverseGridding
  This may just call applyE.
  Alternatively, this could do pre-density compensation and then call applyE
Need to make a function called gridding
  This will do density compensation, and then call applyET.
